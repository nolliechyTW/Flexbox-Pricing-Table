# Flexbox-Pricing-Table
create a responsive pricing table with CSS

This project is a flexbox pricing table designed to showcase different pricing plans for a service or product. It includes three different pricing plans - Basic, Standard, and Premium - with varying features and prices. The table is responsive and adjusts to fit the screen size of different devices. Each pricing plan displays its features and price in a clean and organized manner, with a clear call-to-action button for users to sign up. The table is also designed with a background image that makes it visually appealing and engaging for users.
